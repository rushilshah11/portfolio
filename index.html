                    each stage of my
                    career up to this point.

                            <p>I chose FastAPI because I needed native async/await support for concurrent API calls to
                                Finnhub. Flask's sync nature would have required workarounds like Celery, adding
                                unnecessary
                                complexity. Django felt too heavy for a focused API service. FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI
                                documentation and Pydantic integration meant I could enforce data contracts at
                                compile-time
                                rather than discovering issues at runtime‚Äîcritical when handling financial data where
                                type
                                safety matters.</p>

                            <h4>AWS SES and S3: Why Not SendGrid or Local Storage?</h4>
                            <p>I evaluated SendGrid and Mailgun for email delivery, but AWS SES made more sense for
                                three
                                reasons: (1) significantly lower cost at scale, (2) tight integration with other AWS
                                services I planned to use (Lambda for future expansion), and (3) better deliverability
                                reputation for transactional emails. For logging, I chose S3 over local filesystem or
                                CloudWatch because I wanted immutable audit trails that survive container restarts, and
                                S3's
                                lifecycle policies let me automatically archive old logs without manual intervention.

                            <h4>Layered Architecture: Preventing Service-ORM Coupling</h4>
                            <p>I strictly separated Routers ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Repositories to avoid the common mistake of
                                embedding SQLAlchemy queries directly in business logic. This meant I could swap
                                PostgreSQL
                                for another database (or add caching) by only touching the repository layer. The Service
                                layer handles password hashing and ETL orchestration without knowing how User objects
                                are
                                stored. This separation also made testing easier‚ÄîI could mock repositories without
                                spinning
                                up a database.</p>

                            <p>The ETL pipeline needed to fetch quotes and profiles for potentially dozens of tickers.
                                Running these sequentially would have caused unacceptable latency. Using
                                <code>asyncio.gather</code> let me fire all requests concurrently, cutting execution
                                time by
                                80%. I used <code>asyncio.to_thread</code> for the Finnhub SDK (which is synchronous) to

                            <h4>Why Build Redis After a Financial Pipeline?</h4>
                            <p>After building the financial pipeline, I realized I was abstracting away critical
                                infrastructure‚ÄîI understood FastAPI and PostgreSQL at a high level, but didn't truly
                                grasp
                                how databases handle concurrent writes or how replication actually works. Building Redis
                                forced me to reason about locking primitives, network protocols, and data persistence
                                from
                                first principles. It's the difference between using a tool and understanding the tool.
                                This
                                project taught me why certain database design decisions exist (like why Redis is
                                single-threaded for most operations).</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="decision-section">
                            <h4>Thread-Per-Connection vs Event Loop</h4>
                            <p>I chose a multi-threaded architecture (one thread per client) over an event loop like
                                asyncio
                                because I wanted to learn traditional concurrency primitives. Redis's actual
                                implementation
                                uses a single-threaded event loop for different reasons (CPU-bound operations), but for
                                a
                                learning exercise, managing <code>threading.Lock</code> and
                                <code>threading.Condition</code>
                                gave me hands-on experience with race conditions and deadlocks. I hit both problems
                                early‚Äîclients would hang during BLPOP, and concurrent ZADD operations would corrupt data
                                until I fixed my locking strategy.

                            <h4>Implementing Blocking Operations: The Hard Parts</h4>
                            <p>BLPOP was the most challenging feature. I needed threads to sleep efficiently when lists
                                were
                                empty, then wake immediately when data arrived. My first attempt used a polling loop
                                (checking every 100ms), which was wasteful and had high latency. The correct solution
                                was
                                <code>threading.Condition</code>‚Äîthreads wait on a condition variable, and RPUSH
                                broadcasts
                                a notification. This pattern taught me why condition variables exist and how databases
                                handle blocked queries without burning CPU.

                            <h4>Replication: Understanding Distributed Systems</h4>
                            <p>Implementing master-replica replication revealed why distributed databases are complex. I
                                had
                                to handle partial command propagation (what if the replica dies mid-sync?), implement
                                PSYNC
                                for incremental updates, and track replica acknowledgments for WAIT commands. The
                                hardest
                                bug was a deadlock in WAIT‚ÄîI was holding a data lock while waiting for replica
                                responses,
                                blocking all other operations. The fix required releasing locks before network I/O,
                                which is
                                a fundamental pattern in databases.</p>

                            <p>Most backend engineers interact with databases through ORMs, which is fine for OLTP
                                workloads
                                but fails for analytics. I built this project to understand how data warehouses differ
                                fundamentally from transactional databases‚Äîdifferent query patterns (aggregations vs
                                point
                                lookups), different schemas (star schema vs normalized), and different optimization
                                strategies (columnar storage, materialized views). This knowledge directly applies when
                                designing APIs that need to serve analytical queries efficiently.</p>

                            <h4>Medallion Architecture: Why Three Layers?</h4>
                            <p>I chose Medallion (Bronze/Silver/Gold) over alternatives like just loading directly into
                                a
                                star schema because it provides clear boundaries for data quality improvements. Bronze
                                preserves raw source data (critical for auditing), Silver handles cleansing without
                                business
                                logic creep, and Gold serves analytics without impacting transformation pipelines. This
                                separation mirrors the layered architecture I used in the FastAPI project‚Äîeach layer has
                                a
                                single responsibility. When data quality issues emerged in the Silver layer, I could fix
                                them without re-ingesting from source or breaking Gold-layer reports.</p>

                            <p>I used ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) instead of ETL because SQL Server can process
                                transformations faster than Python. Loading raw CSVs into Bronze, then transforming
                                in-database using SQL, leverages the database's query optimizer and parallelism. ETL
                                (transforming before loading) makes sense when the source system is too slow or you need
                                complex logic that SQL can't express, but for structured CSV data, in-database
                                transformations were 5x faster in my tests.</p>

                            <p>I evaluated three options: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, React, and Vue. Raw HTML would have meant
                                duplicating navigation/footer markup across pages and manually managing DOM updates for

                                appointment form. Vue was tempting for its simplicity, but React's ecosystem (more
                                libraries, better TypeScript support, larger community) made it the pragmatic choice.
                                The
                                component-based model meant I could build <code>Employee.js</code> once and render it

                                different props‚Äîimpossible with static HTML without templating engines.</p>

                                    <p>I joined Trojan Marketing Group my first year at USC to bridge my interests in
                                        technology and business.
                                        TMG works with four clients each year, spending one semester developing
                                        data-driven
                                        strategy and the next
                                        executing the campaign. As I grew from Technologist to Director of Technology, I
                                        focused on building tools
                                        that made our strategic and creative decisions smarter.</p>

                                    <h5>YouTube Brand Analysis Dashboard</h5>
                                    <p>While working with Mailmodo, I noticed our team needed better insights from
                                        YouTube
                                        analytics. I built an
                                        internal
                                        Python scraper using the YouTube Data API to analyze engagement metrics and SEO
                                        performance. This year, I
                                        expanded
                                        it into a React-based dashboard so that any member could input a channel ID and
                                        instantly retrieve insights like
                                        top-performing videos, tag frequency, and engagement patterns‚Äîno coding

                                    </p>

                                    <h5>YAT√â Spotify Drink Recommendation App</h5>
                                    <p>For YAT√â, a beverage brand with strong musical roots, I helped develop a
                                        full-stack
                                        web app that let users log in
                                        through Spotify. We analyzed their listening data to recommend personalized
                                        drink
                                        pairings during on-campus
                                        tastings, creating an interactive and memorable brand experience.</p>

                                    <p>These projects showed me how much I enjoy building technology that directly
                                        influences marketing strategy and

                                    <h4>Understanding Finance Through Systems</h4>
                                    <p>I chose wealth management because of the finance component of my Computer Science
                                        and
                                        Business Administration
                                        degree.
                                        I wanted to see how financial advising actually works in practice ‚Äî how markets
                                        move, how clients think, and how
                                        data shapes real investment decisions.</p>

                                    <p>Wealth management is extremely dynamic. Markets shift, clients shift, and
                                        strategies
                                        must adjust constantly.
                                        During my time there, I worked on:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Market research to identify and segment high-net-worth prospects</li>
                                        <li>Client data analysis using Excel and Merrill‚Äôs Personal Wealth Analysis tool
                                            to
                                            support financial planning
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>What I enjoyed was seeing how technology and data directly influence decisions
                                        that
                                        impact people‚Äôs financial
                                        lives.
                                        But I also realized something important about myself:
                                        I didn‚Äôt resonate with the client-facing side of the role.</p>

                                    <p>I didn‚Äôt want to be the person presenting insights.
                                        I wanted to be the one building the systems that generate those insights.</p>

                                    <p>At the bank, the engineers build the platforms that traders and advisors rely on
                                        every day.
                                        And that‚Äôs where I found my direction:
                                        supporting the people making financial decisions by engineering the tools they
                                        depend on.</p>

                                    <h4>CMS & User-Centric Design</h4>

                                    <p>At NASA JPL, I worked on the NASA Web Mod initiative to migrate the existing
                                        science.nasa.gov website into a new
                                        CMS.
                                        It was my first time contributing to a large, public-facing codebase, and I
                                        remember
                                        immediately feeling the
                                        scale and
                                        rigor of the engineering environment around me.</p>

                                    <p>A core part of my role was ensuring <b>accessibility compliance</b> ‚Äî not just
                                        automated checks, but detailed
                                        manual testing.
                                        This meant verifying keyboard navigation flows, evaluating screen reader
                                        behavior,
                                        and making sure the platform
                                        supported
                                        users with different abilities. It was slow, methodical, and required a level of
                                        precision I hadn‚Äôt experienced
                                        before.</p>

                                    <p>During this time, I gained exposure to:</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Structured engineering workflows</li>
                                        <li>GitHub issue tracking & pipelines</li>
                                        <li>Code review discussions and standards</li>
                                        <li>Designing with the user experience always in mind</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>But the most impactful realization was that I was increasingly drawn to what sits
                                        <i>behind</i> the interface ‚Äî
                                        the systems, architecture, data flow, and logic that allow these platforms to
                                        operate reliably at scale.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>This experience is where I recognized that I want to grow further into <b>backend
                                            engineering</b>, working with
                                        systems,

                                    </ul>

                                    <p>The second issue was information inconsistency. Because the clinic was small,
                                        business hours and service details
                                        weren‚Äôt regularly updated on Google or Apple Maps. Patients often had to call
                                        just
                                        to confirm basic information.
                                    </p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Pain Point #2:</b> Provide one central hub with up-to-date, reliable
                                            clinic
                                            information.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p>So my task became clear: <b>design a clean, friendly, and easy-to-use website
                                            that
                                            allows patients to book
                                            appointments online and view accurate clinic information ‚Äî without requiring
                                            the
                                            staff to regularly maintain
                                            it.</b></p>

                                    <p>Through this project, I learned React.js, Firebase, EmailJS, version control,
                                        Figma,
                                        and how to translate
                                        real-world business constraints into product decisions. It was also my first
                                        deep
                                        dive into frontend design ‚Äî
                                        rewarding, but it helped me realize that I‚Äôm more energized by logic, data flow,
                                        and
                                        system architecture than
                                        visual styling alone.</p>

                                    <p><b>Measurable Impact:</b> The online booking system reduced front desk workload
                                        by
                                        <b>~20%</b> and contributed to
                                        <b>50+ new patient appointments</b>, proving to me how software can directly
                                        improve
